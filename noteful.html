            <div class="home-text-1">For my HCI capstone project, I worked with Noteful, a music startup, on reimagining their learning experiences for younger audiences. What started out as a simple dashboard redesign evolved into a complete redesign of their UX/UI, in order to engage and motivate students. <span class="bold-text">As my team's design lead, I was responsible for leading the ideation and prototype phases</span>. Our redesign helped launch Noteful, drawing 300+ new users in one month, as well as receiving positive industry feedback from music professionals.</div>

            <h2 class="proj-heading-1">Problem Space</h2>
            <p>Many children perceive music theory as boring, tedious, and "totally uncool." Despite the challenges, music theory is the language of music; it is a core part in playing an instrument, composing music, and more. <span class="bold-text">This is why Noteful created a free and fun way to teach it.</span> For this project, we looked into bridging the gap between their goals and their UX/UI.</p>

        <div class="small-2">
            <h2 class="proj-heading-1">Solution Highlights</h2>
            <p>Fun and free for everyone, <span class="bold-text">Noteful's redesign combines gamification with a user-friendly interface, ensuring that learners of all ages can grasp complex concepts in a simple and entertaining way.</span> Our innovative system introduces streaks that celebrate your commitment to learning by highlighting your consistent practice days. From real-time feedback and exploration, interactive musical creations, and more, this engaging UX/UI approach ensures that every interaction is not only educational but also fun, bringing the auditory aspect of music theory to life.</p>

            <p>Since we couldn’t test long-term engagement within project scope, I directed my team to use user feedback and research to validate our design decisions, maximizing our 4-month timeline and setting Noteful up for future success.</p>

            <p>Noteful's redesign resulted in 300+ new users in just one month, and earned positive reviews from both educators and learners. Through this project, I recognize one of the reasons <span class="bold-text">my team was able to achieve success was due to consistent communication.</span> Everyone was openminded, which created an environment filled with feedback and learning. We were able to explore ideas and improve upon our design from feedback of users and stakeholders.</p>
