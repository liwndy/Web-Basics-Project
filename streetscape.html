            <p>NYC DCP plans for the future of New York City, committed to making its public data freely available to all members. Specifically, the IT Division of Department of City Planning (DCP) is responsible for all of the agency's digital services and products, including a broad portfolio of internal and public-facing web and mapping tools.</p>

            <p>However, given the diversity of the products, <span class="bold-text">DCP doesn't follow any standardized design guidelines</span>. This can lead to several issues, including:</p>

            <h2 class="proj-heading-1">Solution Highlights</h2>
            <p>I reimagined Streetscape, NYC DCP's design system, in order <span class="bold-text">to unify digital products for a consistent and accessible experience across the organization</span>. Given the time, I focused on revising the foundations of the design system, including six different design libraries, as well as streamlining the workflows between designers and developers, providing extensive documentation on how design elements should be used.</p>

            <p>With limited experience in design system, I faced a steep learning curve when starting this project, but it reminded me <span class="bold-text">to keep learning, be my own leader, and skillfully use resources</span> I have to my advantage. In addition, I was designing not only for users but also engineers, designers, stakeholders, and more. This means having an understanding of everything involved and <span class="bold-text">to adapt to workflows</span>, as opposed to changing everything entirely.</p>
